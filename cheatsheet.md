This file will contain documentation for all commands available in your game.

Note:  It's a good idea to also make this list available inside the game, in response to a `HELP` command.


create a username
add a catchphrase
collect a "collectible"
use a "collectible"
find out how many lives you have
access cheatsheet by typing "help"*

# SPOILER ALERT

If your game includes challenges that must be overcome to win, also list them below.

***** how do we call methods from other classes generally
    - make them static (there's only one copy of this)
    - move some things around
**** we need typeerror messages 
**** create question instance automatically 
***** storing all questions and answer in some type of data structure and not writing it out into the code (ex: a file)
    - questions outside the do loop
**** create multiple instances of GameLoop
