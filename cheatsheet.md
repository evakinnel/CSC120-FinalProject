# SPOILER ALERT

If your game includes challenges that must be overcome to win, also list them below.

***** how do we call methods from other classes generally
**** we need typeerror messages 
**** create question instance automatically 
***** storing all questions and answer in some type of data structure and not writing it out into the code (ex: a file)
**** create multiple instances of GameLoop
