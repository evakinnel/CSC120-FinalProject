# CSC120-FinalProject
Deliverables:
Your final codebase
Your revised annotated architecture diagram

**Design justification** 
We decided to forego a map based approach in favor of a chronological approach because we are basing the game on a book. We wanted readers to be able to follow the game based on the events of the book, since the characters actions in the book set the stage for what they can do later.

**Additional Reflection Questions**
What was your overall approach to tackling this project?
Our approach to this project was to make a program that was both engaging for the player as well as put our coding skills to the test. We wanted the game to feel realistic so we used riddles and phrases that would feel familiar to anyone who reads Harry Potter books. 

What new thing(s) did you learn / figure out in completing this project?
It is hard to list how much we have learned because for every single implementation of the game we came acorss a problem we didn't know how to fix. It wasn;t until we were in the final editing phase where we could say "oh we fixed an error like this before". To put it generally we learned just fow effective object oriented prgramming is, we were so surprised by how much less code we had to write thanks to objectification. The way our program handled questions was remarkable, we were able to insert questions, choices and correct answers in one line and then loop through them easily.


Is there anything that you wish you had implemented differently?
We don't wish that we implemented anything differently, but we wish we had more time to include many more of our ideas, we think we would have had a really exciting, complex and immersive game if this were a bigger project.

If you had unlimited time, what additional features would you implement?
We would have implemented a character feature where we could create personas for people from the book and they would have specific roles to either help harry(the player) in the game or try to derail him. We would also wanted to add the role of victim, which would be the person we intend to save on the adventure.
We also would have liked to have several levels and/or make the levels non chronological so that the players could choose which book in the series they want the game to be inspired by.

What was the most helpful piece of feedback you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?
The most helpful piece of feedback came from our professor Jordan. He opened our eyes to how we could further objectify parts of our games, like the questions, to make them easier to work with. 

If you could go back in time and give your past self some advice about this project, what hints would you give?
We would have two tips:
- Start early
- Pick a topic we were all completely familiar with, for example: Marvel. We all had differnt degrees of familiarity with Harry Potter ranging from never reading the books to reading several times. This meant we are differently passionate about staying true to the details from the book. 

If you worked with a team: please comment on how your team dynamics influenced your experience working on this project.
As mentioned before, our different levels of harry potter obsession was a source of bickering at times. 
We also learned that everyone has a thing they are very particular about, for example grammar and spelling. Overall we all agree that working together was a really great experience. It was nice that we were comfortable with each other, we all had differing yet complementary strengths, and we were all at the same pace in terms of our timeline for working on the project.
