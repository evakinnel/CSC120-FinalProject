# CSC120-FinalProject
Deliverables:
Your final codebase
Your revised annotated architecture diagram

**Design justification** 
We decided to forego a map based approach in favor of a chronological approach because we are basing the game on a book. We wanted readers to be able to follow the game based on the events of the book, since the characters actions in the book set the stage for what they can do later.

A map of your game's layout (if applicable)
