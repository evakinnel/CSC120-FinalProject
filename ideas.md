We should call lives something other than "lives"
- like suspicion/sneaky something, and if someone gets too susupicious, you'll get expelled and cannot finish

**Story Chamber:**

Player is welcomed back to hogwarts and told they are suspicious of Draco and must get Crabbe and Goyle out of the way
    so they can become them with polyjuice potion and talk to malfoy
__Moaning myrtle says riddle__
if they guess sleeping draught - correct, plan goes well, they discover a diary at the sight of the blood wall on the way back
    they get a hint from malfoy 
if they select fire - oh no crabbe and goyle were seriously injured, must heal them 
    (the player must complete some side task...delays completion instead of making it impossible to move forward)
    they get a hint from malfoy
if they select honey - plan fails and you lose a life (don't get a hint from malfoy)
    but they still should find the diary because or else nothing could happen

__Task in order to unlock the book:__
must type something PRESCICELY into the console 
    ex: "CaN yoU tELL Me?"
if done correctly - they gain the ability to use the diary to see the past
if not, they lose a life but go into the diary anyway for the sake of gameplay

Other things that happen
- people are getting petrified 
- gilderoy lockhart
- aragog/spiders
- dobby
